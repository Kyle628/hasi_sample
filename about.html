                <P class="pad_top_md">Häsi is <b>painted</b> with intention—in process, but also <i>ingredients</i>. Our blue and yellow colors come naturally from butterfly pea flowers and turmeric root. And the ingredients themselves come from people, and stories Häsi believes in. These agents of visual creative give purpose to our slogan: <b>Art is in Bread</b>.</P>
                <p>Heirloom Single Origin <b>Turmeric</b>
                        Grown on small farms in the Andhra Pradesh region of India, this turmeric contains 2x the curcumin content over store bought brands. Curcumin is the <i>good stuff</i>—the active ingredient—in turmeric: anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and improved brain function are some of the studied health benefits of the spice. Beyond its nutritional value, turmeric renders a warm, yellow tint that reminds us of <b>beautiful</b> California sunshine.</p>
                <p>Butterfly Blue Pea Flowers
                        These flowers are what Gregor Mendel (the “father” of modern genetics) used to <i>pioneer</i> the study of how genes are passed down. Pea flowers come in a variety of colors, and because of their <b>strong</b> pigment, Mendel was able to identify color differences in his research. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        Sourced from Thailand, <b>Häsi</b> uses the pea flower for natural blue coloring. And studies suggest that they come with their own string of health benefits: antioxidant, anti-anxiety, anti-depression, bioflavonoid, and more. Like with turmeric, butterfly pea flowers exhibit both <b>nutritional</b> benefit as well as captivating aesthetic.

                        The Art is in Bread process begins with our <b>canvas—flour</b>. And at Häsi, we craft our own with <b>in-house milling</b>. We take “whole grain” honestly and bake with <i>un-sifted</i> flour, <b>warm off the mill</b>. That’s because we believe that baking with freshly milled <b>organic grains</b> unlocks nutrient power you can feel. On the path to Art is in Bread, that’s important to us. Häsi uses a combination of two wheat berries—<i>Khorasan</i> and <i>Rye</i>—for a signature flavor experience.
                </p>
                <p><b>Khorasan</b>: originating from the <i>Fertile Crescent</i> (specifically, modern day Afghanistan), this grain is unique by aesthetic, nutrition, and flavor. At almost <i>twice</i> the size of modern day wheat, Khorasan offers a respectable nutritional resume, containing a <b>higher ratio of protein, vitamins and minerals</b> than modern wheat. Most importantly, Khorasan renders a <i>rich flavor</i> and a <i>textured bite</i> that we love. </p>
                <p><b>Rye</b>: An ancient and robust grain—rye brings out an identifiable <i>aroma</i> and <b>strong character</b>. Although originating in southwestern Asia and dating back to 1800 B.C, this grain is familiar as the basis for most European breads. Particularly, rye is <b>foundational</b> to the traditional Austrian “Roggenbrot”, a dark bread. Packed with soluble fiber, and containing <b>less gluten</b> than other wheat, this grain is brimming with nutrient density and bold aroma.</p>

                        Häsi bread is brought to life through a <b>living</b> organism called “levain”.  It’s a <b>culture</b> of wild yeast and <i>microbiomes </i>that develop in flour & water over time, and <b>gives rise</b> to <i>real</i> bread. Some call it a “mother-dough” or “sourdough starter” and we use it to ferment our dough—it’s is the way bread has been made for <b>centuries</b>. And we believe in doing things the way they’ve been done, just as much as innovating.
                </p>
                <p>The process of fermentation “pre-digests” flour, making it <b>easier on our gut</b> while adding <i>unmistakable flavor</i>. The wild yeasts and other good bacterium break down carbohydrates into simple sugars, and introduce complex flavors that make Häsi bread epically <i>delicious</i>. But <b>it takes time</b>. A resource we don’t like to waste, but Häsi believes is integral to artisanal process and flavor. Each batch of our bread takes <b>over 24 hours</b> to produce, and the <i>result</i> is why we stick to it.</p>
                <p>Häsi’s levain is named <i>Dwight</i>, and he was born on January 15th, 2018. We feed him a <b>strong diet</b> of baker’s craft flour and filtered water because a <b>healthy levain</b> is the foundation to great bread. Dwight lives—he adapts to changing environments and therefore requires daily care. But that gives him <b>character</b>, and we love him for that. We keep him happy and <b>active</b> so that he can keep us happy and active with the <i>gift</i> of bread.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="pad_top_md">Häsi takes its baker’s roots in <b>Austrian</b> tradition. Growing up, Häsi—the baker—made annual trips from Los Angeles to Austria to visit <b>family</b> and friends. There, good bread was a daily pleasure. And when a baker’s family offered to host a baking workshop, <i>generational</i> technique and progressive vision collided to form what is now <b>Häsi Bread</b>.</p>
                <p>Da Sticklerbäck, led by head baker “Pepi” Stickler, was bakery to Austria’s Puchberg am Shneeberg—a mountain region with breathtaking views and <b>countryside culture</b>. They acted as village bakery for over <i>170 years</i> and the span of 4 generations.
                        However, as big grocers and pre-baked frozen alternatives came in at a competitive price, their business suffered. Pepi Stickler and family were forced to retire an <b>ancestral</b> profession. 
                        </p>
                <p>When Häsi visited the Sticklers first in 2017, their shop had been closed for years. But they opened their <b>home</b> and <b>knowledge</b> to talk tradition and technique. No expectation—just to help a home baker bake better bread through the <i>Austrian lens</i>.</p>
                <p>Häsi spent 2018 baking—practicing learned Austrian technique, but also adding <b>California flair</b>. Later, Häsi revisited the Stickler’s as a newly skilled baker with applied vision. </p>
                <p>Häsi layers the vibrations of California sunshine to an <b>age old</b> Austrian way of bread making. We use color to reflect our brand vision and <b>revitalize</b> how people see bread, but at the core, we are <b>rooted in tradition</b>. After all, what keeps our fans coming back for more is epic bread—in flavor, texture, and feeling. And that comes from the <i>Art</i> of bread making—a technique passed down from Austria’s Da Sticklerbäck, and given new life in California’s Häsi Bread.</p>
